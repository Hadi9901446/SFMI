# SFMI
The manuscript introduces the Sentinel-2 Flood Mapping Index (SFMI), a novel tool designed to improve the accuracy of water and flood area detection using Sentinel-2 imagery.
The SFMI leverages visible and near-infrared bands from Sentinel-2 data, utilizing 10-meter resolution bands to more effectively mitigate errors caused by spectral and spatial variations.
